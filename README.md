A Zabbix module providing detailed incident investigation with temporal patterns, occurrence heatmaps, SLA impact, and action timeline.

**Developed by [Monzphere](https://monzphere.com)**

---

## What the module provides

- **Temporal patterns**: heatmap showing which weekdays and hours incidents occur most frequently
- **Monthly drill-down**: click a month to see daily distribution of incidents
- **Monthly comparison**: trend (↗ ↘ →) and percentage change vs previous month
- **SLA by service**: impact on affected services with SLI/SLO, visual gauge and compact tree
- **Timeline and Actions**: toggle between event list and actions table (alerts, commands, status) using native Zabbix layout
- **Recommendations**: highest-risk hours and days for planning
- **Quick comparison**: "Same slot last week" and "Same day last week" when filters are applied
- **Export**: report exportable via print/PDF
- **Direct access**: magnifying glass icon (🔍) on the problem list and problem widgets that opens investigation for that event
- **Maintenance integration**: visualization of maintenance periods and their correlation with incidents (see [Maintenance integration](#maintenance-integration) below)

---

## Maintenance integration

The module displays Zabbix maintenances in the investigation views to help correlate incidents with planned maintenance windows.

### Where maintenances appear

- **Heatmap (day × hour)**: Cells that had incidents during a maintenance period show a wrench icon (🔧). The legend "Icon = incident during maintenance" explains this.
- **Last 12 months**: Each month has an orange bar below the incident bar when maintenances occurred in that month. The number inside the bar indicates how many maintenances. **Click** the orange bar to open a tooltip (Zabbix native style) with the list of maintenances and their date ranges.
- **Daily distribution (drilldown)**: When you click a month, each day shows segments. Orange segments indicate days with maintenance; the number shows how many maintenances that day. **Click** a segment to see details in a tooltip.

### How it works

- Maintenances are fetched for the host and host groups of the incident, for the last 12 months.
- Recurring timeperiods (daily, weekly, monthly) are expanded into concrete segments.
- Legends remain visible even when there are no maintenances in the current view.

### Permissions

- **Configuration → Maintenance** read access is required for maintenance data to be shown.

---

## Requirements

- Zabbix 7.0.x and 7.4.x (tested on both versions)
- PHP 8.0+
- Zabbix with Services and SLA configured (optional, for SLA impact panel)

If the module does not work on your Zabbix version, please open an [issue]([https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/timepattern-incident-investigation/issues](https://github.com/Monzphere/TimePattern/issues)) on GitHub.

## Installation

### 1. Download the module

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Monzphere/TimePattern.git
# or download the ZIP and extract
```

### 2. Copy to Zabbix

Copy the module folder to Zabbix's modules directory:

```bash
cp -r TimePattern /usr/share/zabbix/modules/TimePattern
```

If the `modules` directory does not exist, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p /usr/share/zabbix/modules
cp -r TimePattern /usr/share/zabbix/modules/TimePattern
```

### 3. Enable the module in Zabbix

1. Go to **Administration → General → Modules**
2. Find **Incident Investigation**
3. Click **Enable**

---

## How to use

The module does not add a menu item. Access is through:

- **From the problem list**: in **Monitoring → Problems**, click the magnifying glass icon (🔍) next to each problem to open the investigation for that event
- **From problem widgets**: the same icon appears on problem widgets in dashboards
- **Direct URL**: `zabbix.php?action=incident.investigation.view&eventid=12345` (replace with the desired eventid)
